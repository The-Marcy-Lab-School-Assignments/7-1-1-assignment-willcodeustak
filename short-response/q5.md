# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

## 2 and 3 will match the `/products/:id` path.

- number 1 cannot match because it only has the static product url and four has another path after the :id so it wont match either.

- 2 and 3 will match because
  `/products/apple`,`/products/5` match `/products/:id`
  under general conditions.

### However, if :id is restricted to only numbers or only strings, the match will depend on that restriction.
