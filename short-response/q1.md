# Question

Is ReactRouter a package for **client-side routing** or **server-side routing**?

# Answer

## ReactRouter is a package for client side routing.

- ReactRouter enables us to simulate navigation between different "pages" in our application but instead of actually loading a new HTML page from the server each time you navigate.

- React Router handles everything within a single-page application. This makes it so there is no delay time for the user and it is a seamless experience.

### Taken from Terms in the repo

- "React Router - Enables navigation and routing in single-page applications (SPAs)"
