# Question

Suppose you have an app that sells phones being served at `www.phones.com`. To view a single phone's details, the user navigates to the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5` where the number `5` is the id of a particular phone.

Using React Router, there is a corresponding route defined to render the `PhoneDetails` component:

```jsx
<Route path="/phones/:phoneId" element={<PhoneDetails />} />
```

Within the `PhoneDetails` component, `useParams` extracts the value of the `phoneId` path parameter (`5`) from the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5`

```jsx
const PhoneDetails = () => {
	const { phoneId } = useParams();

	// code to render the phone details
};
```

What is the data type of `phoneId`?

# Answer

## The data type of phoneId is a string. It is a string because the useParams hook extracts URL parameters as text by default.

useParams: This hook gets the variable parts of the URL (the parts that arenâ€™t static but are added by you as new routes or pages) and returns them as strings.

- converting to string has benefits such as being easy to work with.
- Able to convert them to other types like numbers using javascript functions like pareseInt(),Number().

- useParams extracts the dynamic parts of the URL, providing values that match the current URL. This ensures that any data or actions you perform are directly related to the specific URL you accessed.

<!-- useParams

This React Router hook extracts URL parameters from the current route. Parameters are always returned as strings, regardless of their original data type in the URL. -->
