# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

(SPAs) provides the users with a more seamless experience that is when they want to navigate to other parts of the website they do not have to wait to be brought over to an entire new page(MPAs), instead
content updates DYNAMICALLY on a single page.

## Benefits

- Feels faster and more responsive because SPA updates dynamically without reloading entire page
- reduced load times
- cleaner code due to routing and states.

## Less server requests are made with SPA's than MPA's because of more effective caching.

While both SPA and MPA have caching. MPA with its complete page reloading means that it has to re-fetch therefore it is not as effective as SPA's caching which stays on the same page and always has everything that was already loaded; cached.
