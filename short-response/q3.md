# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer

 When none of the "< route > components" have a match then we will have "*" as like a safe guard to catch all the unmatched routes.

- for example directing users to a default component 404 page when they are trying to navigate to a route that does not exist/ is not any of the routes intended for use.
